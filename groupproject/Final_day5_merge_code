## final combined code for group 2 for day5 
# Reading the data
data<-read_delim (here("groupproject", "exam_nontidy.txt")) 
# step 1 finding the duplication
data %>%   
 distinct()%>% 
#Step2 checking whether any column starts with a number or space 
glimpse(data)%>% 
# yes, the volume measurement variable has a space in the variable name 

Step 3Are all variables columns?
head(data)%>%
